### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

**Pipeline**
* Conversion to grayscale
* Gaussian filter
* Canny edge detection
* Region of interest
* Hough transform

My pipeline consists of 5 steps. First, the image is converted to grayscale. Second, it is passed to gaussian filter with kernel size 11x11 to make it look smoother than the original gray-scaled image. Third, the filtered image is passed to Canny edge detection function to find edge lines. Fourth, the edge line image is passed to the region of interest. Fifth, the masked image is passed to hough transform, then generates the output image.

I created "averaging()" and "form_line()" functions, in addition to the draw_lines() function. "averaging()" function takes all the linear lines and finds average of the slope and intercept of left and right lines of each frames . "form_line()" function calls "averaging()" to generate extrapolated linear lines for both left and right lanes.
Below are averaging() and form_line():

**averaging()**
~~~~
def averaging(lines):
    #This function finds average slope and intercept of lines in a frame.
    left_slope = []
    left_intercept = []
    right_slope = []
    right_intercept = []

    for line in lines:
        if line is not None:
            for x1,y1,x2,y2 in line:
                if x1 != x2:
                    slope = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1)
                    b = y1 - slope * x1 # Intercept b from y = slope*x + b
                    if (abs(slope) > 0.5):
                        if slope < 0: #left-side
                            left_slope.append(slope)
                            left_intercept.append(b)
                        else: #right-side
                            right_slope.append(slope)
                            right_intercept.append(b)
        else:
            None

    # Find average of intercept and slope of lines on a frame
    if len(left_slope) > 0:
        avg_left_slope = sum(left_slope)/len(left_slope)
        avg_left_intercept = sum(left_intercept) / len(left_intercept)
    if len(right_slope) > 0:
        avg_right_slope = sum(right_slope)/len(right_slope)
        avg_right_intercept = sum(right_intercept) / len(right_intercept)

    if (avg_left_slope is not None) and (avg_left_intercept is not None) and (avg_right_slope is not None) and (avg_right_intercept is not None):
        return avg_left_slope,avg_left_intercept,avg_right_slope,avg_right_intercept
    else:
        return None

**form_line()**

~~~~

def form_line(img, lines):
    #This function creates a linear line from avg_slope and avg_inetercept.
    if averaging(lines) is None:
        return None
    else:
        #### Extrapolated lines are generated here ####
        avg_left_slope,avg_left_intercept,avg_right_slope,avg_right_intercept = averaging(lines)
        y1 = img.shape[0]
        y2 = y1 * 0.6

        # x-coordinates from equation y = mx + b => x = (y - b)/m
        x1_left = (y1 - avg_left_intercept)/avg_left_slope
        x2_left = (y2 - avg_left_intercept)/avg_left_slope
        x1_right = (y1 - avg_right_intercept)/avg_right_slope
        x2_right = (y2 - avg_right_intercept)/avg_right_slope

        # Convert x1,y1,x2,y2 to int
        y1 = int(y1)
        y2 = int(y2)
        x1_left = int(x1_left)
        x2_left = int(x2_left)
        x1_right = int(x1_right)
        x2_right = int(x2_right)

        return ((x1_left,y1),(x2_left,y2)), ((x1_right,y1),(x2_right,y2)) #left_line, right_line
~~~~
Then, I pass left_line and right_line to draw_line2() function in pipeline as shown below

~~~~
# Hough transform
left_line, right_line = form_line(image,lines)

# Generate processed image
result = draw_lines2(image, (left_line,right_line))
~~~~

draw_lines2() function returns the final image after weighting the original image with the line-masked image

~~~~
def draw_lines2(img, lines, color=[255, 0, 0], thickness=15):
    """
        This function draws generated linear lines on the original image.
    """
    #Black background with lines only
    line_image = np.zeros_like(img)
    #Draw lines on line_image
    for line in lines:
        if line is not None:
            cv2.line(line_image, *line, color, thickness)

    #return: image = original_image*1 + line_image*0.8
    return weighted_img(line_image, img, α=1., β=0.8, λ=0.)

### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline

One potential shortcoming is that the averaging function would not work at the curve of lane lines. And another shortcoming is when there is shadow on the road, the edge detection would produce unclear line images. This problem would fail to generate detect-lines.


### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline
When the lane lines have inconsistent brightness, due to shadow, I would need to use color filter other than grayscale conversion filter. And possible solution for the curve lane problem can be reduce the height of parallelogram mask in region of interest function, so that it would mask out the curved part of both left and right lanes, and I could extrapolate the detect lines later.
